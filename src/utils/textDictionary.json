I like to spend some time discussing what you hear in your head and/or your ideal sound and we will make that happen...but there’s no need for a fully realized \"grand plan\" either! By getting to know you and the music you love I can craft music that \"fits\" you, in any genre. It’s always completely collaborative, loose and fun.",

It turned me off to getting my music produced, until I was referred to Craig. From the get go, he asked what my song's reference materials are, what is the mood/tone/genre I am trying to capture  and he listens to the feedback I give about the process. I love going into the studio, feeling like I am in a safe zone to be free to express what I am hearing in my head. The best part, Craig's intuitive nature allows him to see what you are hearing and put that down into vivid notes that enhance the song you, as the artist, have created. Craig is a wizard who comes up with new sounds that always get me excited to see the song's progression. He is a great collaborator and incredibly talented engineer. I cannot recommend him enough!",
